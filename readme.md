# Coding tasks for data engineers  


Hi this is the coding task for data engineers. The application is in Spark and can be implemented using Scala/Java for the ETL operations. 

The objective of the task is to implement a big data application job that can scale for big data. The application also must pass the unit test cases given and the expected output results.
You may add more test cases to check the robustness of the application as you wish. 

Following are the steps to be followed: 

    1. Fork the project and create a new branch for your implementation
    2. Implement the function, according to documentation and tests
    3. Run and pass all tests
    4. Update the chapter "Describe your solution" in the README files
    5. Create a pull request
